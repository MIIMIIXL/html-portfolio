<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Mimi, and I'm on a journey to become a full stack web developer with a passion for creativity,<br /> design, and meaningful digital experiences. I believe that the web is more than just code — it’s a canvas for connection, healing,<br /> and empowerment. Whether I’m building a soothing virtual altar app or exploring front-end design patterns, I bring heart,<br /> intention, and curiosity into every project.

Outside of coding, you’ll probably find me brainstorming business ideas, designing custom<br /> press-on nails, leveling up in The Sims, or indulging in a little Lofi music and a strong cup of coffee. This is only<br /> the beginning of my tech path — and I can’t wait to see where it leads.
